Working Environment
===================

You have several options in setting up your working environment.  I recommend
using virtualenv to separate the dependencies of your project from your system's
python environment.

If on Linux or Mac OS X, you can also use virtualenvwrapper to help manage 
multiple virtualenvs across different projects.


Installation of Dependencies
=============================

$ pip install -r requirements.txt



Run Script
=============================

Into 'testproject' folder run:

$ python main.py #OPTIONS

or

$ ./main.py #OPTIONS
